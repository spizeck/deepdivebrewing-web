# About Deep Dive Brewing Co

Deep Dive Brewing Co is a small, family-run craft brewery located on the island of Saba. We brew approachable, well-balanced beers designed for our climate, our community, and the people who call this island home — whether they’ve lived here for generations or just arrived by sea or air.

## The Brewery

Our brewing philosophy is simple: make beer that people want to drink more than one of.

We focus on balance, consistency, and approachability rather than extremes. That means beers that suit warm days, long evenings, and shared tables — not novelty for novelty’s sake. Every recipe is built with drinkability in mind and refined through careful water filtration, mineral adjustment, and cold filtration to ensure both quality and shelf stability in a challenging island environment.

We are small but professional, and we grow carefully. Under-promising and over-delivering matters to us, and we believe sustainable growth is the only way to protect quality over the long term.

## Our Story

Chad and Katy moved to Saba in 2021 to purchase Sea Saba, a local dive center. Like many people who fall in love with the island, they quickly realized that while Saba offers extraordinary natural beauty and community, one thing was missing: good, locally brewed beer.

What began as casual conversations — with former Sea Saba staff member Svenja, who brewed beer with her father, and with friends and family back in Arizona — slowly turned into something more serious. In 2023, Chad decided to sit down and write a business plan. To everyone’s surprise, the numbers worked.

Over the following months, the plan grew more refined, and the idea gained momentum. Jill, preparing to retire and move to Saba to be closer to her grandchildren, joined the project along with her partner Tim, who had apprenticed at a brewery in Peoria, Arizona. Confident that great beer could be brewed on Saba, the group purchased a small homebrew system that became the pilot brewhouse and began developing recipes locally.

The final piece came together when Wim of Juliana’s Hotel and Tropics Café — a long-time Saba business owner — joined as an initial investor. Together, the group raised the capital needed to purchase a professional brewing system from Alpha Brewing Operations in Nebraska.

The equipment arrived in October 2024. The first batch was brewed in December and sold in January 2025.

## The Island

Saba is remote, unspoiled, and deeply focused on sustainability. Brewing here comes with real logistical challenges. We receive a shared container approximately every two weeks, and coordinating ingredients to arrive at the right place in Florida — and then make it onto that container — takes careful planning. Even after arrival, it can take days or longer for materials to reach us.

Our brewery is compact — a 26' × 26' space with 9-foot ceilings — located at Fort Bay Harbor. Gas is prohibitively expensive on the island, so we brew entirely using electricity. These constraints shape how we work, pushing us to be efficient, thoughtful, and intentional in every decision.

The diving culture on Saba naturally fosters environmental awareness, and that mindset carries directly into how we brew. Sustainability isn’t a slogan here — it’s a daily consideration.

## Community & Beyond

Deep Dive Brewing Co is deeply rooted in the local community. Our spent brewing grains are reused by locals for animal feed, compost, dog treats, and other creative applications. We also provide filtered water to the Marine Laboratory, helping reduce their need to purchase distilled water for experiments.

Today, most bars and restaurants on Saba carry our beer, and more are coming on board as demand grows. Beyond the island, we’ve begun introducing our beer to Sint Maarten, starting with locations like the IGY Marina Bar and Amsterdam Cheese & Liquor Store in Philipsburg.

We’re flexible, collaborative, and genuinely enjoy working with businesses to make our beer successful for everyone involved.

Deep Dive Brewing Co exists because we love this island, the people on it, and the idea that great beer doesn’t have to come from far away to be worth drinking.
