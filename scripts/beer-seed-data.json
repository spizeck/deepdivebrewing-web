    "descriptionShort": "This American Amber is smooth and malt-forward with a clean, refreshing finish. Brewed with North American malts from Canada and the U.S., it delivers rich notes of caramel, toffee, and a touch of light roast. El Dorado hops provide a gentle, balancing bitterness, while Cascade added at flame-out brings subtle citrus and floral aromatics. At 30 IBUs, the bitterness stays restrained, allowing the malt character to remain the focus without becoming heavy or sweet.",
